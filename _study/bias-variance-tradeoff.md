## 1. Bias and Variance

**1.1 Conceptual Definition**

- Error due to **Bias**
  - Error from erroneous assumptions in the underlying model
  - The expected value by which the model differs from the reality
  - If these average prediction values are substantially different to the true value, the bias will be high.
